# implement a game of digits:

## rule of the game.
- one player thinks of a number of certain number of digits.
  - (eg for 4 digits number, he thought of 1234)
- the other player start guessing the number.
  - (eg. other player guessed it is 2435)
- the first player then has to say how many digits in the guesses number where right and how many were in the correct position. 
  - (so in the guessed number in above example, 3 digits were correct: 2, 4, and 3 and only 3 was in correct position. so the first player says: 3 correct digits, 1 correct position)
- second player retries the guess. and the process is repeated till the second player guesses the number correctly. the number of attempts is recorded and displayed as: 'You guessed the number in x guesses'


here let the program itself be the first player and guesses the random number of 3 digits(000 - 999).
generate random string of from 0-9 using randint(0,9) method of previous exercise and concatenating the digit generated by the function.

```python
from random import randint # we are using something from a package random
random_digit= randint(0, 9) # generates a random number from 0 to 9

# your code here
```

# hint
```python
# you can access some string's  nth item just like you are accessing an item from a list

random_string = "kamehameha"

print(random_string[0]) # prints k
print(random_string[1]) # prints a
print(random_string[2]) # prints m
print(random_string[-1]) # prints a
```
read the string manipulation article below for more knowledge.

**BONUS:** after your first iteration of successful implementation of the program, study the principle DRY(Dont Repeat Yourself) from the resource section below and try to refactor the repeated codes(if any) into a function.
